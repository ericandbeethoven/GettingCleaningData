# GettingCleaningData

This is the Getting and Cleaning Data course submission.

The project assignment was to get raw data, clean it and build a tiny data set as an output. The data source was 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The project instructions were:

You should create one R script called [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/ericandbeethoven/GettingCleaningData/blob/master/run_analysis.r) that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository provides a script (run_analysis.R) that is documented in the Codebook, a tidy dataset (tidymeans.txt), and a codebook (CodeBook.md).
